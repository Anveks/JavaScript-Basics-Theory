Notes on the Number object:

1. Number.parseInt(something) / Number.parseFloat("something"):
- turns everything into a number + gets rid of all the unnecessary strings, for example: Number.parseInt("33px") will return "33";

2. Number.isNan():
- checks if something is NOT a number;

3. Number.isFinite():
- also checks if something is a number;  is designed to check for finite numbers though.
