Official site: https://www.typescriptlang.org/

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that extends JavaScript. Developed and presented by Microsoft in 2012. In terms of features, here are 10 significant differences between JavaScript and TypeScript:

1. TypeScript can be strongly typed, while JavaScript is dynamically typed only.
2. TypeScript is more readable and maintainable than JavaScript.
3. TypeScript supports abstraction through interfaces, while JavaScript does not.
4. TypeScript allows developers to annotate code with decorators, while JavaScript does not.
5. TypeScript supports the ability to modularize and organize components through the use of namespaces, which is not supported in JavaScript.
6. TypeScript is more expressive than JavaScript, through the use of syntax elements such as optional and named parameters.
7. TypeScript supports generics and a type inference feature that is not available in JavaScript.
8. TypeScript IDEs have more features, as it is easier to build plugins and tools for a statically typed language.
9. TypeScript code is easier to debug as the codebase expands, because type errors can be discovered at compilation time rather than runtime.
10. TypeScript implements additional features beyond the limited ECMAScript specification to which JavaScript complies.

## TypeScript Benefits:

- Static Typing: TypeScript is known for its strong static typing feature. It allows developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors at compile time, providing better code quality and preventing runtime errors.

- Type Annotations: TypeScript allows you to annotate variables and functions with type information. This helps in documenting the code and providing clear expectations about the data being used.

- Type Inference: TypeScript can infer types based on how variables and functions are used. This reduces the need for explicit type annotations while still providing type checking.

- Interfaces and Classes: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features like interfaces and classes. This makes it easier to define complex data structures and models.

- Transpilation: TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript code before running in a browser or Node.js environment. This means that TypeScript code can target different ECMAScript versions and still be compatible with older browsers.

- Compilation Checks: TypeScript provides compile-time checks for errors, helping you catch issues early in the development process. JavaScript, being dynamically typed, relies more on runtime checks for type-related errors.

- Compatibility: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This allows developers to gradually adopt TypeScript in existing projects.

- Tooling and IDE Support: TypeScript offers rich tooling, including advanced autocompletion, refactoring support, and better IntelliSense in IDEs like Visual Studio Code.

- ES Next Features: TypeScript often incorporates upcoming ECMAScript features before they are officially supported in browsers. This enables developers to use modern JavaScript features earlier.

- Community and Ecosystem: JavaScript has a larger user base and ecosystem due to its long history. TypeScript's community and ecosystem are growing, but JavaScript still has a broader range of libraries and frameworks available.

## Class vs Object

**Object** is a composite data type that groups together variables (known as properties or fields) and functions (methods) into a single unit. They provide a way to organize and structure data in a more meaningful and manageable manner. Objects allow you to encapsulate data and behavior related to a specific entity in your program. They play a central role in many programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming (OOP), where objects are used to model real-world entities and interactions between them.

**Class** is a template used to create instances of classes - as objects. Has pre-defined list of properties and methods, and a constructor function used to initialize the new instances. Objects made out of a class are created with 'new' keyword.
