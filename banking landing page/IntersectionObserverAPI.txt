 The IntersectionObserver is a web API that provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport. It's commonly used to implement lazy loading of images, infinite scrolling, and other features based on element visibility in the viewport.

 usage:

 1. create an observer:

    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options);


2. set the target element to observe:

    const targetElement = document.querySelector('.target-element');

3. define the callback func (gets invoked based upon the options!):

    function callback(entries, observer) {
      entries.forEach(entry => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          // The target element is now in the viewport
        } else {
          // The target element is not in the viewport
        }
      });
    }

4. activate the observer:

    observer.observe(targetElement);
